typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.1. What is XHTML?</H2>
<P>XHTML is the reformulation of HTML 4 as an application of XML. XHTML 1.0 <A 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/references.html#ref_xhtml1">[XHTML1]</A> 
specifies three XML document types that correspond to the three HTML 4 DTDs: 
Strict, Transitional, and Frameset. XHTML 1.0 is the basis for a family of 
document types that subset and extend HTML.</P>
<H2 id="s_intro_whatismod" about="#s_intro_whatismod" typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.2. 
What is XHTML Modularization?</H2>
<P>XHTML Modularization is a decomposition of XHTML 1.0, and by reference HTML 
4, into a collection of abstract modules that provide specific types of 
functionality. These abstract modules are implemented in this specification 
using the XML Schema and XML Document Type Definition languages. The rules for 
defining the abstract modules, and for implementing them using XML Schemas and 
XML DTDs, are also defined in this document.</P>
<P>These modules may be combined with each other and with other modules to 
create XHTML subset and extension document types that qualify as members of the 
XHTML-family of document types. <EM>Note that while this specification only 
contains trivial examples of combining these modules into markup languages. For 
more complete examples, see [<A class="nref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/references.html#ref_xhtmlbasic">XHTMLBASIC</A>] 
or [<A class="nref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/references.html#ref_xhtml11">XHTML11</A>].</EM></P>
<H2 id="s_intro_xhtml_mods" about="#s_intro_xhtml_mods" 
typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3. Why Modularize XHTML?</H2>
<P>The modularization of XHTML refers to the task of specifying well-defined 
sets of XHTML elements that can be combined and extended by document authors, 
document type architects, other XML standards specifications, and application 
and product designers to make it economically feasible for content developers to 
deliver content on a greater number and diversity of platforms.</P>
<P>Over the last couple of years, many specialized markets have begun looking to 
HTML as a content language. There is a great movement toward using HTML across 
increasingly diverse computing platforms. Currently there is activity to move 
HTML onto mobile devices (hand held computers, portable phones, etc.), 
television devices (digital televisions, TV-based Web browsers, etc.), and
 appliances (fixed function devices). Each of these devices has different 
requirements and constraints.</P>
<P>Modularizing XHTML provides a means for product designers to specify which 
elements are supported by a device using standard building blocks and standard 
methods for specifying which building blocks are used. These modules serve as 
"points of conformance" for the content community. The content community can now 
target the installed base that supports a certain collection of modules, rather 
than worry about the installed base that supports this or that permutation of 
XHTML elements. The use of standards is critical for modularized XHTML to be 
successful on a large scale. It is not economically feasible for content 
developers to tailor content to each and every permutation of XHTML elements. By 
specifying a standard, either software processes can autonomously tailor content
 to a device, or the device can automatically load the software required to 
process a module.</P>
<P>Modularization also allows for the extension of XHTML's layout and 
presentation capabilities, using the extensibility of XML, without breaking the 
XHTML standard. This development path provides a stable, useful, and 
implementable framework for content developers and publishers to manage the 
rapid pace of technological change on the Web.</P>
<H3 id="s_intro_abstract" about="#s_intro_abstract" typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3.1. 
Abstract modules</H3>
<P>An XHTML document type is defined as a set of abstract modules. A abstract 
module defines one kind of data that is semantically different from all others. 
Abstract modules can be combined into document types without a deep 
understanding of the underlying schemas that define the modules.</P>
<H3 id="s_intro_module_implementation" about="#s_intro_module_implementation" 
typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3.2. Module implementations</H3>
<P>A module implementation consists of a set of element types, a set of 
attribute-list declarations, and a set of content model declarations, where any 
of these three sets may be empty. An attribute-list declaration in a module may 
modify an element type outside the element types defined in the module, and a 
content model declaration may modify an element type outside the element type
 set of the module.</P>
<P>One implementation mechanism is XML DTDs. An XML DTD is a means of describing 
the structure of a class of XML documents, collectively known as an XML document 
type. XML DTDs are described in the XML 1.0 Recommendation <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/references.html#ref_xml">[XML]</A>. 
Another implementation mechanism is XML Schema <A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/references.html#ref_xmlschema">[XMLSCHEMA]</A>. 
For purposes of discussion in this document, we refer to the various 
implementations of XHTML Modularization as "schema".</P>
<H3 id="s_intro_hybrid" about="#s_intro_hybrid" typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3.3. 
Hybrid document types</H3>
<P>A hybrid document type is an document type composed from a collection of XML 
document types or Modules. The primary purpose of the modularization framework 
described in this document is to allow a document type author to combine 
elements from multiple abstract modules into a hybrid document type, develop 
documents against that hybrid document type, and to validate that document 
against the associated hybrid schema.</P>
<P>One of the most valuable benefits of XML over SGML is that XML reduces the 
barrier to entry for standardization of element sets that allow communities to 
exchange data in an interoperable format. However, the relatively static nature 
of HTML as the content language for the Web has meant that any one of these 
communities have previously held out little hope that their XML document types 
would be able to see widespread adoption as part of Web standards. The 
modularization framework allows for the dynamic incorporation of these diverse 
document types within the XHTML-family of document types, further reducing the 
barriers to the incorporation of these domain-specific vocabularies in XHTML 
documents.</P>
<H3 id="s_intro_validation" about="#s_intro_validation" 
typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3.4. Validation</H3>
<P>The use of well-formed, but not valid, documents is an important benefit of 
XML. In the process of developing a document type, however, the additional 
leverage provided by a validating parser for error checking is important. The 
same statement applies to XHTML document types with elements from multiple 
abstract modules.</P>
<P>An XHTML-family document is an instance of one particular document type as 
specified by the document's author, either in the document's prologue or through 
some other mechanism (e.g., the <CODE>schemaLocation</CODE> attribute). 
Validating the document is the process of testing whether the document complies 
with the rules in the associated schema.</P>
<P>One document can consist of multiple document fragments. Validating only 
fragments of a document, where each fragment is of a different document type 
than the other fragments in the document, is beyond the scope of this framework 
- since it would require technology that is not yet defined.</P>
<P>However, the modularization framework allows multiple schema to be integrated 
and form a new document type (e.g. SVG integrated into XHTML). The new schema 
can be used for normal XML 1.0 validation.</P>
<H3 id="s_intro_formatting" about="#s_intro_formatting" 
typeof="bibo:Chapter">1.3.5. Formatting Model</H3>
<P>Earlier versions of HTML attempted to define parts of the model that user 
agents are required to use when formatting a document. With the advent of HTML 
4, the W3C started the process of divorcing presentation from structure. XHTML 
1.0 maintained this separation, and this document continues moving HTML and its 
descendants down this path. Consequently, this document makes no requirements on 
the formatting model associated with the presentation of documents marked up 
with XHTML Family document types.</P>
<P>Instead, this document recommends that content authors rely upon style 
mechanisms such as CSS to define the formatting model for their content. When 
user agents support the style mechanisms, documents will format as expected. 
When user agents do not support the style mechanisms, documents will format as 
appropriate for that user agent. This permits XHTML Family user agents to 
support rich formatting models on devices where that is appropriate, and lean 
formatting models on devices where <EM>that</EM> is appropriate.</P>
